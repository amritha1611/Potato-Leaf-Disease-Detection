# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection
The aim is to detect and classify potato leaf diseases using CNN. Potato is one of the most important crops worldwide, and its productivity can be affected by various diseases, including leaf diseases. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of leaf diseases can help prevent their spread and minimize crop losses. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great potential in image classification tasks, including disease detection in plants. Here we have classified the data into three classes:
